By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.<h4>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.<h4><br>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.<br><h4>Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?</h4><br>No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.<br><h4>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?</h4><br>UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation."], ["video", ""], ["image", "images/Myth.jpg"], ["created_at", "2020-03-25 17:04:38.665295"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-25 17:04:38.665295"]]

If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth<br><h6>Why?</h6> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.<br><h5>Practice respiratory hygiene</h5><br>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.

Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

Most people who become infected experience mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others. <br>Take care of your health and protect others by doing the following:<br><h4>Wash your hands frequently</h4><br>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<br><h6>Why?</h6> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<br>Maintain social distancing<br>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br><h6>Why?</h6> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth<br><h6>Why?</h6> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.<br><h5>Practice respiratory hygiene</h5><br>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.<br><h6>Why?</h6> Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.<br><h5>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</h5><br>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.

Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.<h5>Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider</h5><br>Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.<br><h6>Why?</h6> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area.

Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.<br>If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition.

Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.<br><h4>Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?</h4><br>No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.

Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.<br><h5>Practice respiratory hygiene</h5><br>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.<br><h6>Why?</h6> Droplets spread virus.

If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.<br><h6>Why?</h6> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.

Most people who become infected experience mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others. <br>Take care of your health and protect others by doing the following:<br><h4>Wash your hands frequently</h4><br>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<br><h6>Why?</h6> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<br>Maintain social distancing<br>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br><h6>Why?</h6> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth<br><h6>Why?</h6> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.<br><h5>Practice respiratory hygiene</h5><br>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.<br><h6>Why?</h6> Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.<br><h5>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</h5><br>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.<br><h6>Why?</h6> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.<h5>Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider</h5><br>Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.<br><h6>Why?</h6> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.<br><h4>Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading</h4><br>Follow the guidance outlined above.<br>Stay at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache and slight runny nose, until you recover. Why?

The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.<br><h4>Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease</h4><br>Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.<h4>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.<h4><br>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.<br><h4>Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?</h4><br>No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.<br><h4>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?</h4><br>UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation."], ["image", "images/Myth.jpg"], ["created_at", "2020-03-26 15:26:29.789412"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-26 15:26:29.789412"]]

If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth<br><h6>Why?</h6> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.<br><h5>Practice respiratory hygiene</h5><br>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.

Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.<br><h4>Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease</h4><br>Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19.

We've compiled 100 suggestions to help make your time quarantined as interesting – and perhaps even as productive – as possible.<br>As we practice self-quarantine, we can take a lesson from Tangled heroine Rapunzel, who has come up with plenty of activities to keep her busy, from cooking to candle-making.<br>Disney Enterprises<ul><p>1. Complete a puzzle: The more pieces the better! Feeling extra saucy? Take on a Rubik's Cube. More of a word person? Crossword puzzle!</p><p>2. Start a journal or blog. Sure, it can be about the coronavirus, but it could also be about a specific interest from chess to cheese. </p><p>3. If it won't bother your neighbors: Dust off that old instrument and practice.</p><p>4. Text all your exes just in case you have one more thing you wanted to get off your chest.</p><p>5. Write poetry. Perhaps you can craft a haiku for Mother's Day, or something without a specific structure. Just try it!</p><p>6. Watch all the really long movies you’ve avoided until now.</p><p>7. Download Duolingo, or a similar app, and teach yourself a foreign language.</p><p>8. Finally read “Infinite Jest,” “Les Miserables” or even “The Stand.” Go all in and read “Ulysses.” You got this. </p><p>9. Meditate. Try lying down with your eyes closed, palms up and while focusing on your breath. Or spend 20 minutes sitting crosslegged and repeat a soothing word to yourself in your head. (The latter is more like transcendental meditation.)</p><p>10. Face masks, moisturizer, oh my! Treat yourself to a 10-step skin care routine you don’t have time for during a normal work week.</p><p>11. Look at pictures of puppies.</p><p>12. Put together the most attractive charcuterie board possible, but you can only use foods you already have in your fridge and cupboard.</p><p>13. Take note from Tangled star Rapunzel, who has an entire song about how she's spent her days alone in a castle. Activities included in her ditty: Ventriloquy, candle-making, papier-mâché and adding a new painting to her gallery.</p><p>14. Write actual letters to family and friends. After that? Write thank-you notes to service people who you remember went out of their way for you.</p><p>15. Learn calligraphy. YouTube can help.</p><p>16. Finally read the rules to those long and intense board games you've never played with the family. Encourage the family to play.</p><p>17. Put on a soap opera. Mute the sound. Create your own dialogue.</p><p>18. Have a space in your home where all of the tupperware goes? Organize it and actually match lids to containers.</p><p>19. Try on all your clothes and determine whether they “spark joy” á la Marie Kondo.</p><p>20. Better yet, go through this process with your junk drawer and supply shelves. </p><p>21. Have a roommate meeting about how to be more considerate of one other, especially while you will likely be spending more time together. Bring baked goods.</p><p>22. Bake those goods.</p><p>23. Watch the films that won Oscars for best picture.</p><p>24. Watch films that won Independent Spirit Awards for best picture. </p><p>25. Watch films that critics say should have won those aforementioned awards.</p><p>26. Read all the New Yorker issues piled on your desk.</p><p>27. Will Tom Hanks into recovery from coronavirus by watching every Tom Hanks movie chronologically. </p><p>28. Knit or crochet.</p><p>29. Use Skype, FaceTime, Google Hangouts or Marco Polo to video chat with your long-distance friends.</p><p>30. Try out at-home aerobics or yoga videos. Consider downloading a fitness app with curated workout playlists.</p><p>31. Look at yourself in the mirror. Attempt a self portrait with pencil and paper.</p><p>32. Take a bubble bath (bonus: Add a glass of wine).</p><p>33. Make a classic cocktail, from negronis to Manhattans and aperol spritzes. Don't forget the garnish.</p><p>34. Coloring books: They’re not just for kids.</p><p>35. Take time to reflect: What have you accomplished in the last year? What goals are you setting for yourself in the next year? </p><p>36. Write a short story or get started on that novel.</p><p>37. Actually try to reproduce something you see on Pinterest. Probably fail. Try again.</p><p>38.

Well, as nice as it sounds, it just isn’t an option for most people.  And since exercise is so important, you need to find exercises that are effective and don’t require any equipment at all.<br> To make these exercises even more fun, you can blast music while you’re doing them. Some you can even do while watching TV.<br> Now you have no more excuses!  Here are 10 great exercises that you can do at home, without the need for any equipment:<br>Walking – If the weather is nice, it’s wonderful to get outside and enjoy the scenery around you while you exercise.  However, if the weather has other ideas, you can just as easily get an effective walking workout at home.  If you have a flight of stairs, go up and down them a few times.  (You could even grab a load of laundry as you’re going that way anyway!)  This will help to tone up your legs, while getting some low impact aerobic exercise as well.  If you don’t have any stairs available, just walk around the house a few times – it may not be very exciting, but it will do the job!<br>Jumping Jacks – These are always fun, as they bring back memories of being a kid!  Who hasn’t done jumping jacks for fun as a child?  Well, surprise – they are also great cardio exercises, and good for warming up, too.<br>Pushups – These are probably not the most favorite exercise of many people, but while they can be hard to do, you can find easier ways to do them.  You don’t need to pretend you’re “Rocky”, and do them with one hand; just do what works for you.  Do them on your knees, instead of keeping your legs straight.  Or, do them standing up against a wall.  You will be building up arm strength and working out muscles in your chest area.<br>Leg Lifts – These are great for building up strength and muscles in your legs.  If you find it hard to do the exercises with your legs straight, try bending them slightly.<br>Crunches – The best exercise for building up and strengthening abdominal muscles.  When you’re just getting started, don’t worry about getting your head all the way up.  So long as you’re going up until you feel the stretching of the muscles, you will see some benefit.<br>Jogging In Place – Jogging is a great exercise for your heart.  You can jog in place at home while watching TV or listening to music.  The only equipment you will require is a good pair of shoes, to eliminate any stress to your legs.<br>Squats – These are wonderful exercises for your legs and buttocks.  You can even just try these by sitting and standing up again from a regular chair, if you’re finding them to be too difficult.  As long as you’re able to do a few repetitions, you will be providing some benefit to your body.<br>Light Weight Lifting – No, you don’t need to go out and buy expensive weights for this!  Just use whatever you can find in your house.  Start out with something lighter, such as a can of peas, and work yourself up to heavier items.  You can use milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles or even water jugs.<br>Dancing – Dancing is a wonderful exercise, which is great for your heart.  Not only that, but it can lift your spirits as well, and give your overall feeling a boost.<br>Step Exercises – Using the steps in your home, you can do repetitions which will tone your leg muscles.  (Just remember to be careful!)<br>Getting some exercise is important, but you don’t need to go out and join a gym, paying a large amount in membership fees each month.  You don’t even need the expensive equipment in order to give your body an effective workout.  Use what you have in your house, and work out in the comfort of your home.  You will be more likely to keep up with the exercises when you’re comfortable, so just get up and start exercising!"], ["title", "10 Ways You CAN Exercise At Home without Any Equipment"], ["img_url", "https://www.fitwatch.com/files/large/runningshoes.jpg"], ["like_count", 10], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 11:00:17.136694"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 11:00:17.136694"]]

Later in 2020, we'll also see new movies like Black Widow added to the canon, along with MCU TV shows like August's The Falcon and Winter Soldier and December's WandaVision, assuming production resumes on the Disney Plus series soon. A Marvel movie marathon is the perfect way to pass the time until they get here, then. <br>Watching the Marvel movies in order should be pretty simple, but there are a few things worth noting first. Watching the Marvel movies in chronological starts in WW2 with Captain America: The First Avengers, with Cap facing off against Red Skull. If you start the Marvel movies in release order, though, you'll want to begin with 2008's Iron Man, the debut of Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man and the MCU itself.<br>Watching the MCU films in order will give you vital context for Marvel Phase 4. Shows like Loki or new films like The Eternals will build on past Marvel movies in important ways. On this page, you'll find lists of the chronological and release orders of the Marvel movies, as well as a ranked list of the best Marvel movies. If you just want to watch the Avengers movies in order, for example, you can skip the duds (sorry, The Incredible Hulk!). In this feature, too, we'll explain which Marvel movies are on Disney Plus in 2020. <br>Ready? Let's begin your Marvel movie marathon...<br>How to watch the Marvel movies in order: chronological order<br>A Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline is probably why you're here. This lists all the Marvel films chronologically from The First Avenger to Avengers: Endgame. The main reason to watch the Marvel movies like this is you'll see important events as they unfolded in the MCU. You'll follow the Tesseract from the '40s to the present, see how Carol Danvers met Nick Fury in the mid-'90s, and follow Thanos' long, brutal journey to acquiring the Infinity Stones.  <br>Here, then, is the chronological viewing order of the Marvel movies:<ul><li>Captain America: The First Avenger (takes place during WWII)</li><li>Captain Marvel (takes place in 1995)</li><li>Iron Man (takes place in 2010)</li><li>Iron Man 2 (takes place after Iron Man)</li><li>The Incredible Hulk (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>Thor (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>The Avengers (takes place in 2012)</li><li>Iron Man 3 (takes place six months after The Avengers)</li><li>Thor: Dark World (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Captain America: Winter Soldier (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy (sometime in 2014)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (after Guardians)</li><li>Avengers: Age of Ultron (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Ant-Man (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Spider-Man: Homecoming (post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Doctor Strange (takes place in 2016)</li><li>Black Panther (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Thor: Ragnarok (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Ant-Man and The Wasp (ambiguous, but fits nicely between IW and Endgame)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (starts in 2017, finishes in 2022)</li><li>Spider-Man: Far From Home (post-Endgame)</li></ul><br>As 2020 Marvel movies like Black Widow and The Eternals are released, along with canonical Disney Plus shows like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (August) and WandaVision (December), we'll add them to this MCU timeline. Black Widow, for example, is definitely set after Captain America: Civil War, but with its release date currently up in the air, we've left it off for now.

Well, as nice as it sounds, it just isn’t an option for most people.  And since exercise is so important, you need to find exercises that are effective and don’t require any equipment at all.<br> To make these exercises even more fun, you can blast music while you’re doing them. Some you can even do while watching TV.<br> Now you have no more excuses!  Here are 10 great exercises that you can do at home, without the need for any equipment:<br>Walking – If the weather is nice, it’s wonderful to get outside and enjoy the scenery around you while you exercise.  However, if the weather has other ideas, you can just as easily get an effective walking workout at home.  If you have a flight of stairs, go up and down them a few times.  (You could even grab a load of laundry as you’re going that way anyway!)  This will help to tone up your legs, while getting some low impact aerobic exercise as well.  If you don’t have any stairs available, just walk around the house a few times – it may not be very exciting, but it will do the job!<br>Jumping Jacks – These are always fun, as they bring back memories of being a kid!  Who hasn’t done jumping jacks for fun as a child?  Well, surprise – they are also great cardio exercises, and good for warming up, too.<br>Pushups – These are probably not the most favorite exercise of many people, but while they can be hard to do, you can find easier ways to do them.  You don’t need to pretend you’re “Rocky”, and do them with one hand; just do what works for you.  Do them on your knees, instead of keeping your legs straight.  Or, do them standing up against a wall.  You will be building up arm strength and working out muscles in your chest area.<br>Leg Lifts – These are great for building up strength and muscles in your legs.  If you find it hard to do the exercises with your legs straight, try bending them slightly.<br>Crunches – The best exercise for building up and strengthening abdominal muscles.  When you’re just getting started, don’t worry about getting your head all the way up.  So long as you’re going up until you feel the stretching of the muscles, you will see some benefit.<br>Jogging In Place – Jogging is a great exercise for your heart.  You can jog in place at home while watching TV or listening to music.  The only equipment you will require is a good pair of shoes, to eliminate any stress to your legs.<br>Squats – These are wonderful exercises for your legs and buttocks.  You can even just try these by sitting and standing up again from a regular chair, if you’re finding them to be too difficult.  As long as you’re able to do a few repetitions, you will be providing some benefit to your body.<br>Light Weight Lifting – No, you don’t need to go out and buy expensive weights for this!  Just use whatever you can find in your house.  Start out with something lighter, such as a can of peas, and work yourself up to heavier items.  You can use milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles or even water jugs.<br>Dancing – Dancing is a wonderful exercise, which is great for your heart.  Not only that, but it can lift your spirits as well, and give your overall feeling a boost.<br>Step Exercises – Using the steps in your home, you can do repetitions which will tone your leg muscles.  (Just remember to be careful!)<br>Getting some exercise is important, but you don’t need to go out and join a gym, paying a large amount in membership fees each month.  You don’t even need the expensive equipment in order to give your body an effective workout.  Use what you have in your house, and work out in the comfort of your home.  You will be more likely to keep up with the exercises when you’re comfortable, so just get up and start exercising!"], ["title", "10 Ways You CAN Exercise At Home without Any Equipment"], ["img_url", "https://www.fitwatch.com/files/large/runningshoes.jpg"], ["like_count", 10], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 11:10:08.879572"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 11:10:08.879572"]]

Later in 2020, we'll also see new movies like Black Widow added to the canon, along with MCU TV shows like August's The Falcon and Winter Soldier and December's WandaVision, assuming production resumes on the Disney Plus series soon. A Marvel movie marathon is the perfect way to pass the time until they get here, then. <br>Watching the Marvel movies in order should be pretty simple, but there are a few things worth noting first. Watching the Marvel movies in chronological starts in WW2 with Captain America: The First Avengers, with Cap facing off against Red Skull.

In this feature, too, we'll explain which Marvel movies are on Disney Plus in 2020. <br>Ready? Let's begin your Marvel movie marathon...<br>How to watch the Marvel movies in order: chronological order<br>A Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline is probably why you're here. This lists all the Marvel films chronologically from The First Avenger to Avengers: Endgame. The main reason to watch the Marvel movies like this is you'll see important events as they unfolded in the MCU. You'll follow the Tesseract from the '40s to the present, see how Carol Danvers met Nick Fury in the mid-'90s, and follow Thanos' long, brutal journey to acquiring the Infinity Stones.  <br>Here, then, is the chronological viewing order of the Marvel movies:<ul><li>Captain America: The First Avenger (takes place during WWII)</li><li>Captain Marvel (takes place in 1995)</li><li>Iron Man (takes place in 2010)</li><li>Iron Man 2 (takes place after Iron Man)</li><li>The Incredible Hulk (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>Thor (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>The Avengers (takes place in 2012)</li><li>Iron Man 3 (takes place six months after The Avengers)</li><li>Thor: Dark World (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Captain America: Winter Soldier (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy (sometime in 2014)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (after Guardians)</li><li>Avengers: Age of Ultron (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Ant-Man (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Spider-Man: Homecoming (post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Doctor Strange (takes place in 2016)</li><li>Black Panther (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Thor: Ragnarok (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Ant-Man and The Wasp (ambiguous, but fits nicely between IW and Endgame)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (starts in 2017, finishes in 2022)</li><li>Spider-Man: Far From Home (post-Endgame)</li></ul><br>As 2020 Marvel movies like Black Widow and The Eternals are released, along with canonical Disney Plus shows like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (August) and WandaVision (December), we'll add them to this MCU timeline.

Whether its a traditional jigsaw or a book of Sudoku, puzzles are extremely stimulating, and they can be purchased at local game shops.<br>If youre looking to compete against someone other than yourself, get some board or card games from that small business. Ask the shopkeepers for their suggestions for the most invigorating and entertaining games that can include all your roommates.<br>Bake or cook something special<br>Instead of going straight to AmazonFresh for grocery deliveries, take the extra time — we know you have it or else you wouldnt be reading this article — to see if independent grocers or farmers markets in your area are offering delivery.

Instead of binging Great British Bake Off for the umpteenth time, get off the couch and make something spectacular yourself.<br>Read some books<br>All those books youve been meaning to read can finally get the attention they deserve. Reach out to your local book store to see how theyre handling the coronavirus outbreak. If the show is delivering or open to quick pop-ins from a limited number of customers at a time, stock up on a pile of books and get to reading.<br>Start an indoor garden<br>It might seem surprising but one of the most effective ways to practice self-care is to take care of something other than yourself. With that in mind, this might be the perfect opportunity to start an indoor garden. Start your plant lady journey by reaching out to your local plant store to find out which type of greenery will do best in your home and if the store is offering delivery during this time. For those of us who dont have yards to escape into while still social distancing, becoming a plant mom will be especially rewarding.<br>COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic.

Well, as nice as it sounds, it just isn’t an option for most people.  And since exercise is so important, you need to find exercises that are effective and don’t require any equipment at all.<br> To make these exercises even more fun, you can blast music while you’re doing them. Some you can even do while watching TV.<br> Now you have no more excuses!  Here are 10 great exercises that you can do at home, without the need for any equipment:<br>Walking – If the weather is nice, it’s wonderful to get outside and enjoy the scenery around you while you exercise.  However, if the weather has other ideas, you can just as easily get an effective walking workout at home.  If you have a flight of stairs, go up and down them a few times.  (You could even grab a load of laundry as you’re going that way anyway!)  This will help to tone up your legs, while getting some low impact aerobic exercise as well.  If you don’t have any stairs available, just walk around the house a few times – it may not be very exciting, but it will do the job!<br>Jumping Jacks – These are always fun, as they bring back memories of being a kid!  Who hasn’t done jumping jacks for fun as a child?  Well, surprise – they are also great cardio exercises, and good for warming up, too.<br>Pushups – These are probably not the most favorite exercise of many people, but while they can be hard to do, you can find easier ways to do them.  You don’t need to pretend you’re “Rocky”, and do them with one hand; just do what works for you.  Do them on your knees, instead of keeping your legs straight.  Or, do them standing up against a wall.  You will be building up arm strength and working out muscles in your chest area.<br>Leg Lifts – These are great for building up strength and muscles in your legs.  If you find it hard to do the exercises with your legs straight, try bending them slightly.<br>Crunches – The best exercise for building up and strengthening abdominal muscles.  When you’re just getting started, don’t worry about getting your head all the way up.  So long as you’re going up until you feel the stretching of the muscles, you will see some benefit.<br>Jogging In Place – Jogging is a great exercise for your heart.  You can jog in place at home while watching TV or listening to music.  The only equipment you will require is a good pair of shoes, to eliminate any stress to your legs.<br>Squats – These are wonderful exercises for your legs and buttocks.  You can even just try these by sitting and standing up again from a regular chair, if you’re finding them to be too difficult.  As long as you’re able to do a few repetitions, you will be providing some benefit to your body.<br>Light Weight Lifting – No, you don’t need to go out and buy expensive weights for this!  Just use whatever you can find in your house.  Start out with something lighter, such as a can of peas, and work yourself up to heavier items.  You can use milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles or even water jugs.<br>Dancing – Dancing is a wonderful exercise, which is great for your heart.  Not only that, but it can lift your spirits as well, and give your overall feeling a boost.<br>Step Exercises – Using the steps in your home, you can do repetitions which will tone your leg muscles.  (Just remember to be careful!)<br>Getting some exercise is important, but you don’t need to go out and join a gym, paying a large amount in membership fees each month.  You don’t even need the expensive equipment in order to give your body an effective workout.  Use what you have in your house, and work out in the comfort of your home.  You will be more likely to keep up with the exercises when you’re comfortable, so just get up and start exercising!"], ["title", "10 Ways You CAN Exercise At Home without Any Equipment"], ["img_url", "https://www.fitwatch.com/files/large/runningshoes.jpg"], ["like_count", 10], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 11:13:53.513764"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 11:13:53.513764"]]

Later in 2020, we'll also see new movies like Black Widow added to the canon, along with MCU TV shows like August's The Falcon and Winter Soldier and December's WandaVision, assuming production resumes on the Disney Plus series soon. A Marvel movie marathon is the perfect way to pass the time until they get here, then. <br>Watching the Marvel movies in order should be pretty simple, but there are a few things worth noting first. Watching the Marvel movies in chronological starts in WW2 with Captain America: The First Avengers, with Cap facing off against Red Skull. If you start the Marvel movies in release order, though, you'll want to begin with 2008's Iron Man, the debut of Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man and the MCU itself.<br>Watching the MCU films in order will give you vital context for Marvel Phase 4. Shows like Loki or new films like The Eternals will build on past Marvel movies in important ways. On this page, you'll find lists of the chronological and release orders of the Marvel movies, as well as a ranked list of the best Marvel movies. If you just want to watch the Avengers movies in order, for example, you can skip the duds (sorry, The Incredible Hulk!). In this feature, too, we'll explain which Marvel movies are on Disney Plus in 2020. <br>Ready? Let's begin your Marvel movie marathon...<br>How to watch the Marvel movies in order: chronological order<br>A Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline is probably why you're here. This lists all the Marvel films chronologically from The First Avenger to Avengers: Endgame. The main reason to watch the Marvel movies like this is you'll see important events as they unfolded in the MCU. You'll follow the Tesseract from the '40s to the present, see how Carol Danvers met Nick Fury in the mid-'90s, and follow Thanos' long, brutal journey to acquiring the Infinity Stones.  <br>Here, then, is the chronological viewing order of the Marvel movies:<ul><li>Captain America: The First Avenger (takes place during WWII)</li><li>Captain Marvel (takes place in 1995)</li><li>Iron Man (takes place in 2010)</li><li>Iron Man 2 (takes place after Iron Man)</li><li>The Incredible Hulk (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>Thor (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>The Avengers (takes place in 2012)</li><li>Iron Man 3 (takes place six months after The Avengers)</li><li>Thor: Dark World (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Captain America: Winter Soldier (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy (sometime in 2014)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (after Guardians)</li><li>Avengers: Age of Ultron (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Ant-Man (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Spider-Man: Homecoming (post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Doctor Strange (takes place in 2016)</li><li>Black Panther (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Thor: Ragnarok (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Ant-Man and The Wasp (ambiguous, but fits nicely between IW and Endgame)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (starts in 2017, finishes in 2022)</li><li>Spider-Man: Far From Home (post-Endgame)</li></ul><br>As 2020 Marvel movies like Black Widow and The Eternals are released, along with canonical Disney Plus shows like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (August) and WandaVision (December), we'll add them to this MCU timeline. Black Widow, for example, is definitely set after Captain America: Civil War, but with its release date currently up in the air, we've left it off for now.

With the CDC calling for Americans to practice social-distancing and limiting our interactions with others, the urge to hang out in your house and binge-watch every show you’ve missed in the last decade is high.<br>While there’s nothing wrong with spending some quality time with your television (we’ve even put together a list of what you should be watching), here are 10 other activities that you could do that don’t involve sitting on your couch all day.<br>First of All, Practice Some Self-Care<br>The world is a little crazy right now. If you’re feeling pressure to fill all of your free time, dont! Instead, take a breath, relax and work on making your self-care game strong.

One major negative effect of the pandemic is that small businesses are suffering. As more people are staying in, these establishments are losing customers and money, which is a big deal for small stores. Another (admittedly less pressing) issue that has arisen as a result of COVID-19 is that many of us suddenly have a lot more free time on our hands, and we dont know what to do with it. It turns out, there are several ways to tackle both these problems at once.<br>If social distancing has you stuck inside going stir crazy, there are several activities you can do to pass the time and keep yourself grounded, and many of those activities can be done with the help of local businesses. Ahead, youll find our suggestions for how to stay busy during the coronavirus outbreak while also supporting small businesses in your area.<br>Take a virtual class<br>While gathering in a classroom might not be advisable right now, thanks to the power of the internet, classes of all kinds are still available. Learning something new and thinking critically are great ways to stave off cabin fever. Since many small language schools in the U.S. and abroad have been forced to shut down in-person sessions, look into how you can support them by signing up for virtual language classes.<br>If its your body that needs exercising right now and not just your mind, check to see if local fitness studios are streaming sessions with instructors. Its tempting to sit in one spot all day when you have nowhere to be, but exercise is known to help with anxiety, and right now, many of us could use all the help we can get in that department.<br>Start a craft project<br>In the past, have youve bristled at the what are your hobbies question simply because you dont have time to do anything just for its own sake? Well, now you might actually have the bandwidth to pick up a hobby, and why not look to the arts and crafts arena? Find a small arts and crafts supply store in your area and purchase everything you'll need to create a masterpiece: think yarn and needles for knitting, needlepoint kits, or paints and canvases. If youre nervous about starting a new creative project, use the store as a resource — one of the best things about small businesses is that those who work at them are almost always extremely passionate about their area of expertise. Theyll likely have advice on where you should start.<br>Do puzzles & play games<br>Another great way to put your brain to work is by doing a puzzle. Whether its a traditional jigsaw or a book of Sudoku, puzzles are extremely stimulating, and they can be purchased at local game shops.<br>If youre looking to compete against someone other than yourself, get some board or card games from that small business. Ask the shopkeepers for their suggestions for the most invigorating and entertaining games that can include all your roommates.<br>Bake or cook something special<br>Instead of going straight to AmazonFresh for grocery deliveries, take the extra time — we know you have it or else you wouldnt be reading this article — to see if independent grocers or farmers markets in your area are offering delivery. If so, order ingredients to cook something thats outside of your regular quick-dinner rotation.<br>Small specialty food stores might also carry baking kits that can help you whip up a treat youd usually only ever buy at a fancy bakery. Instead of binging Great British Bake Off for the umpteenth time, get off the couch and make something spectacular yourself.<br>Read some books<br>All those books youve been meaning to read can finally get the attention they deserve. Reach out to your local book store to see how theyre handling the coronavirus outbreak. If the show is delivering or open to quick pop-ins from a limited number of customers at a time, stock up on a pile of books and get to reading.<br>Start an indoor garden<br>It might seem surprising but one of the most effective ways to practice self-care is to take care of something other than yourself. With that in mind, this might be the perfect opportunity to start an indoor garden. Start your plant lady journey by reaching out to your local plant store to find out which type of greenery will do best in your home and if the store is offering delivery during this time.

Well, as nice as it sounds, it just isn’t an option for most people.  And since exercise is so important, you need to find exercises that are effective and don’t require any equipment at all.<br> To make these exercises even more fun, you can blast music while you’re doing them. Some you can even do while watching TV.<br> Now you have no more excuses!  Here are 10 great exercises that you can do at home, without the need for any equipment:<br>Walking – If the weather is nice, it’s wonderful to get outside and enjoy the scenery around you while you exercise.  However, if the weather has other ideas, you can just as easily get an effective walking workout at home.  If you have a flight of stairs, go up and down them a few times.  (You could even grab a load of laundry as you’re going that way anyway!)  This will help to tone up your legs, while getting some low impact aerobic exercise as well.  If you don’t have any stairs available, just walk around the house a few times – it may not be very exciting, but it will do the job!<br>Jumping Jacks – These are always fun, as they bring back memories of being a kid!  Who hasn’t done jumping jacks for fun as a child?  Well, surprise – they are also great cardio exercises, and good for warming up, too.<br>Pushups – These are probably not the most favorite exercise of many people, but while they can be hard to do, you can find easier ways to do them.  You don’t need to pretend you’re “Rocky”, and do them with one hand; just do what works for you.  Do them on your knees, instead of keeping your legs straight.  Or, do them standing up against a wall.  You will be building up arm strength and working out muscles in your chest area.<br>Leg Lifts – These are great for building up strength and muscles in your legs.  If you find it hard to do the exercises with your legs straight, try bending them slightly.<br>Crunches – The best exercise for building up and strengthening abdominal muscles.  When you’re just getting started, don’t worry about getting your head all the way up.  So long as you’re going up until you feel the stretching of the muscles, you will see some benefit.<br>Jogging In Place – Jogging is a great exercise for your heart.  You can jog in place at home while watching TV or listening to music.  The only equipment you will require is a good pair of shoes, to eliminate any stress to your legs.<br>Squats – These are wonderful exercises for your legs and buttocks.  You can even just try these by sitting and standing up again from a regular chair, if you’re finding them to be too difficult.  As long as you’re able to do a few repetitions, you will be providing some benefit to your body.<br>Light Weight Lifting – No, you don’t need to go out and buy expensive weights for this!  Just use whatever you can find in your house.  Start out with something lighter, such as a can of peas, and work yourself up to heavier items.  You can use milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles or even water jugs.<br>Dancing – Dancing is a wonderful exercise, which is great for your heart.  Not only that, but it can lift your spirits as well, and give your overall feeling a boost.<br>Step Exercises – Using the steps in your home, you can do repetitions which will tone your leg muscles.  (Just remember to be careful!)<br>Getting some exercise is important, but you don’t need to go out and join a gym, paying a large amount in membership fees each month.  You don’t even need the expensive equipment in order to give your body an effective workout.  Use what you have in your house, and work out in the comfort of your home.  You will be more likely to keep up with the exercises when you’re comfortable, so just get up and start exercising!"], ["title", "10 Ways You CAN Exercise At Home without Any Equipment"], ["img_url", "https://www.fitwatch.com/files/large/runningshoes.jpg"], ["like_count", 10], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 11:24:16.788318"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 11:24:16.788318"]]

Later in 2020, we'll also see new movies like Black Widow added to the canon, along with MCU TV shows like August's The Falcon and Winter Soldier and December's WandaVision, assuming production resumes on the Disney Plus series soon. A Marvel movie marathon is the perfect way to pass the time until they get here, then. <br>Watching the Marvel movies in order should be pretty simple, but there are a few things worth noting first. Watching the Marvel movies in chronological starts in WW2 with Captain America: The First Avengers, with Cap facing off against Red Skull. If you start the Marvel movies in release order, though, you'll want to begin with 2008's Iron Man, the debut of Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man and the MCU itself.<br>Watching the MCU films in order will give you vital context for Marvel Phase 4. Shows like Loki or new films like The Eternals will build on past Marvel movies in important ways. On this page, you'll find lists of the chronological and release orders of the Marvel movies, as well as a ranked list of the best Marvel movies. If you just want to watch the Avengers movies in order, for example, you can skip the duds (sorry, The Incredible Hulk!). In this feature, too, we'll explain which Marvel movies are on Disney Plus in 2020. <br>Ready? Let's begin your Marvel movie marathon...<br>How to watch the Marvel movies in order: chronological order<br>A Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline is probably why you're here. This lists all the Marvel films chronologically from The First Avenger to Avengers: Endgame. The main reason to watch the Marvel movies like this is you'll see important events as they unfolded in the MCU. You'll follow the Tesseract from the '40s to the present, see how Carol Danvers met Nick Fury in the mid-'90s, and follow Thanos' long, brutal journey to acquiring the Infinity Stones.  <br>Here, then, is the chronological viewing order of the Marvel movies:<ul><li>Captain America: The First Avenger (takes place during WWII)</li><li>Captain Marvel (takes place in 1995)</li><li>Iron Man (takes place in 2010)</li><li>Iron Man 2 (takes place after Iron Man)</li><li>The Incredible Hulk (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>Thor (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>The Avengers (takes place in 2012)</li><li>Iron Man 3 (takes place six months after The Avengers)</li><li>Thor: Dark World (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Captain America: Winter Soldier (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy (sometime in 2014)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (after Guardians)</li><li>Avengers: Age of Ultron (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Ant-Man (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Spider-Man: Homecoming (post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Doctor Strange (takes place in 2016)</li><li>Black Panther (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Thor: Ragnarok (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Ant-Man and The Wasp (ambiguous, but fits nicely between IW and Endgame)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (starts in 2017, finishes in 2022)</li><li>Spider-Man: Far From Home (post-Endgame)</li></ul><br>As 2020 Marvel movies like Black Widow and The Eternals are released, along with canonical Disney Plus shows like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (August) and WandaVision (December), we'll add them to this MCU timeline. Black Widow, for example, is definitely set after Captain America: Civil War, but with its release date currently up in the air, we've left it off for now.

One major negative effect of the pandemic is that small businesses are suffering. As more people are staying in, these establishments are losing customers and money, which is a big deal for small stores. Another (admittedly less pressing) issue that has arisen as a result of COVID-19 is that many of us suddenly have a lot more free time on our hands, and we dont know what to do with it. It turns out, there are several ways to tackle both these problems at once.<br>If social distancing has you stuck inside going stir crazy, there are several activities you can do to pass the time and keep yourself grounded, and many of those activities can be done with the help of local businesses. Ahead, youll find our suggestions for how to stay busy during the coronavirus outbreak while also supporting small businesses in your area.<br>Take a virtual class<br>While gathering in a classroom might not be advisable right now, thanks to the power of the internet, classes of all kinds are still available. Learning something new and thinking critically are great ways to stave off cabin fever. Since many small language schools in the U.S. and abroad have been forced to shut down in-person sessions, look into how you can support them by signing up for virtual language classes.<br>If its your body that needs exercising right now and not just your mind, check to see if local fitness studios are streaming sessions with instructors. Its tempting to sit in one spot all day when you have nowhere to be, but exercise is known to help with anxiety, and right now, many of us could use all the help we can get in that department.<br>Start a craft project<br>In the past, have youve bristled at the what are your hobbies question simply because you dont have time to do anything just for its own sake? Well, now you might actually have the bandwidth to pick up a hobby, and why not look to the arts and crafts arena? Find a small arts and crafts supply store in your area and purchase everything you'll need to create a masterpiece: think yarn and needles for knitting, needlepoint kits, or paints and canvases. If youre nervous about starting a new creative project, use the store as a resource — one of the best things about small businesses is that those who work at them are almost always extremely passionate about their area of expertise. Theyll likely have advice on where you should start.<br>Do puzzles & play games<br>Another great way to put your brain to work is by doing a puzzle. Whether its a traditional jigsaw or a book of Sudoku, puzzles are extremely stimulating, and they can be purchased at local game shops.<br>If youre looking to compete against someone other than yourself, get some board or card games from that small business. Ask the shopkeepers for their suggestions for the most invigorating and entertaining games that can include all your roommates.<br>Bake or cook something special<br>Instead of going straight to AmazonFresh for grocery deliveries, take the extra time — we know you have it or else you wouldnt be reading this article — to see if independent grocers or farmers markets in your area are offering delivery. If so, order ingredients to cook something thats outside of your regular quick-dinner rotation.<br>Small specialty food stores might also carry baking kits that can help you whip up a treat youd usually only ever buy at a fancy bakery. Instead of binging Great British Bake Off for the umpteenth time, get off the couch and make something spectacular yourself.<br>Read some books<br>All those books youve been meaning to read can finally get the attention they deserve. Reach out to your local book store to see how theyre handling the coronavirus outbreak. If the show is delivering or open to quick pop-ins from a limited number of customers at a time, stock up on a pile of books and get to reading.<br>Start an indoor garden<br>It might seem surprising but one of the most effective ways to practice self-care is to take care of something other than yourself. With that in mind, this might be the perfect opportunity to start an indoor garden. Start your plant lady journey by reaching out to your local plant store to find out which type of greenery will do best in your home and if the store is offering delivery during this time.

Well, as nice as it sounds, it just isn’t an option for most people.  And since exercise is so important, you need to find exercises that are effective and don’t require any equipment at all.<br> To make these exercises even more fun, you can blast music while you’re doing them. Some you can even do while watching TV.<br> Now you have no more excuses!  Here are 10 great exercises that you can do at home, without the need for any equipment:<br>Walking – If the weather is nice, it’s wonderful to get outside and enjoy the scenery around you while you exercise.  However, if the weather has other ideas, you can just as easily get an effective walking workout at home.  If you have a flight of stairs, go up and down them a few times.  (You could even grab a load of laundry as you’re going that way anyway!)  This will help to tone up your legs, while getting some low impact aerobic exercise as well.  If you don’t have any stairs available, just walk around the house a few times – it may not be very exciting, but it will do the job!<br>Jumping Jacks – These are always fun, as they bring back memories of being a kid!  Who hasn’t done jumping jacks for fun as a child?  Well, surprise – they are also great cardio exercises, and good for warming up, too.<br>Pushups – These are probably not the most favorite exercise of many people, but while they can be hard to do, you can find easier ways to do them.  You don’t need to pretend you’re “Rocky”, and do them with one hand; just do what works for you.  Do them on your knees, instead of keeping your legs straight.  Or, do them standing up against a wall.  You will be building up arm strength and working out muscles in your chest area.<br>Leg Lifts – These are great for building up strength and muscles in your legs.  If you find it hard to do the exercises with your legs straight, try bending them slightly.<br>Crunches – The best exercise for building up and strengthening abdominal muscles.  When you’re just getting started, don’t worry about getting your head all the way up.  So long as you’re going up until you feel the stretching of the muscles, you will see some benefit.<br>Jogging In Place – Jogging is a great exercise for your heart.  You can jog in place at home while watching TV or listening to music.  The only equipment you will require is a good pair of shoes, to eliminate any stress to your legs.<br>Squats – These are wonderful exercises for your legs and buttocks.  You can even just try these by sitting and standing up again from a regular chair, if you’re finding them to be too difficult.  As long as you’re able to do a few repetitions, you will be providing some benefit to your body.<br>Light Weight Lifting – No, you don’t need to go out and buy expensive weights for this!  Just use whatever you can find in your house.  Start out with something lighter, such as a can of peas, and work yourself up to heavier items.  You can use milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles or even water jugs.<br>Dancing – Dancing is a wonderful exercise, which is great for your heart.  Not only that, but it can lift your spirits as well, and give your overall feeling a boost.<br>Step Exercises – Using the steps in your home, you can do repetitions which will tone your leg muscles.  (Just remember to be careful!)<br>Getting some exercise is important, but you don’t need to go out and join a gym, paying a large amount in membership fees each month.  You don’t even need the expensive equipment in order to give your body an effective workout.  Use what you have in your house, and work out in the comfort of your home.  You will be more likely to keep up with the exercises when you’re comfortable, so just get up and start exercising!"], ["title", "10 Ways You CAN Exercise At Home without Any Equipment"], ["img_url", "https://www.fitwatch.com/files/large/runningshoes.jpg"], ["like_count", 10], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 11:27:57.028285"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 11:27:57.028285"]]

You'll follow the Tesseract from the '40s to the present, see how Carol Danvers met Nick Fury in the mid-'90s, and follow Thanos' long, brutal journey to acquiring the Infinity Stones.  <br>Here, then, is the chronological viewing order of the Marvel movies:<ul><li>Captain America: The First Avenger (takes place during WWII)</li><li>Captain Marvel (takes place in 1995)</li><li>Iron Man (takes place in 2010)</li><li>Iron Man 2 (takes place after Iron Man)</li><li>The Incredible Hulk (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>Thor (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>The Avengers (takes place in 2012)</li><li>Iron Man 3 (takes place six months after The Avengers)</li><li>Thor: Dark World (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Captain America: Winter Soldier (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy (sometime in 2014)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (after Guardians)</li><li>Avengers: Age of Ultron (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Ant-Man (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Spider-Man: Homecoming (post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Doctor Strange (takes place in 2016)</li><li>Black Panther (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Thor: Ragnarok (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Ant-Man and The Wasp (ambiguous, but fits nicely between IW and Endgame)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (starts in 2017, finishes in 2022)</li><li>Spider-Man: Far From Home (post-Endgame)</li></ul><br>As 2020 Marvel movies like Black Widow and The Eternals are released, along with canonical Disney Plus shows like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (August) and WandaVision (December), we'll add them to this MCU timeline. Black Widow, for example, is definitely set after Captain America: Civil War, but with its release date currently up in the air, we've left it off for now.

With the CDC calling for Americans to practice social-distancing and limiting our interactions with others, the urge to hang out in your house and binge-watch every show you’ve missed in the last decade is high.<br>While there’s nothing wrong with spending some quality time with your television (we’ve even put together a list of what you should be watching), here are 10 other activities that you could do that don’t involve sitting on your couch all day.<br>First of All, Practice Some Self-Care<br>The world is a little crazy right now. If you’re feeling pressure to fill all of your free time, dont! Instead, take a breath, relax and work on making your self-care game strong.

Think “True American” from New Girl or “Cones of Dunshire” from Parks and Recreation.<br>Or, if you want to keep it nice and simple, a deck of cards can provide hours of entertainment for the whole family.

One major negative effect of the pandemic is that small businesses are suffering. As more people are staying in, these establishments are losing customers and money, which is a big deal for small stores. Another (admittedly less pressing) issue that has arisen as a result of COVID-19 is that many of us suddenly have a lot more free time on our hands, and we dont know what to do with it. It turns out, there are several ways to tackle both these problems at once.<br>If social distancing has you stuck inside going stir crazy, there are several activities you can do to pass the time and keep yourself grounded, and many of those activities can be done with the help of local businesses. Ahead, youll find our suggestions for how to stay busy during the coronavirus outbreak while also supporting small businesses in your area.<br>Take a virtual class<br>While gathering in a classroom might not be advisable right now, thanks to the power of the internet, classes of all kinds are still available. Learning something new and thinking critically are great ways to stave off cabin fever. Since many small language schools in the U.S. and abroad have been forced to shut down in-person sessions, look into how you can support them by signing up for virtual language classes.<br>If its your body that needs exercising right now and not just your mind, check to see if local fitness studios are streaming sessions with instructors. Its tempting to sit in one spot all day when you have nowhere to be, but exercise is known to help with anxiety, and right now, many of us could use all the help we can get in that department.<br>Start a craft project<br>In the past, have youve bristled at the what are your hobbies question simply because you dont have time to do anything just for its own sake? Well, now you might actually have the bandwidth to pick up a hobby, and why not look to the arts and crafts arena? Find a small arts and crafts supply store in your area and purchase everything you'll need to create a masterpiece: think yarn and needles for knitting, needlepoint kits, or paints and canvases. If youre nervous about starting a new creative project, use the store as a resource — one of the best things about small businesses is that those who work at them are almost always extremely passionate about their area of expertise. Theyll likely have advice on where you should start.<br>Do puzzles & play games<br>Another great way to put your brain to work is by doing a puzzle. Whether its a traditional jigsaw or a book of Sudoku, puzzles are extremely stimulating, and they can be purchased at local game shops.<br>If youre looking to compete against someone other than yourself, get some board or card games from that small business. Ask the shopkeepers for their suggestions for the most invigorating and entertaining games that can include all your roommates.<br>Bake or cook something special<br>Instead of going straight to AmazonFresh for grocery deliveries, take the extra time — we know you have it or else you wouldnt be reading this article — to see if independent grocers or farmers markets in your area are offering delivery. If so, order ingredients to cook something thats outside of your regular quick-dinner rotation.<br>Small specialty food stores might also carry baking kits that can help you whip up a treat youd usually only ever buy at a fancy bakery. Instead of binging Great British Bake Off for the umpteenth time, get off the couch and make something spectacular yourself.<br>Read some books<br>All those books youve been meaning to read can finally get the attention they deserve. Reach out to your local book store to see how theyre handling the coronavirus outbreak. If the show is delivering or open to quick pop-ins from a limited number of customers at a time, stock up on a pile of books and get to reading.<br>Start an indoor garden<br>It might seem surprising but one of the most effective ways to practice self-care is to take care of something other than yourself. With that in mind, this might be the perfect opportunity to start an indoor garden. Start your plant lady journey by reaching out to your local plant store to find out which type of greenery will do best in your home and if the store is offering delivery during this time.

Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.<br><h4>Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.</h4><br>There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.<br><h4>Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease</h4><br>Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.<h4>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.<h4><br>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.<br><h4>Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?</h4><br>No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.<br><h4>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?</h4><br>UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation."], ["image", "images/Myth.jpg"], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 09:16:43.794829"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 09:16:43.794829"]]

Well, as nice as it sounds, it just isn’t an option for most people.  And since exercise is so important, you need to find exercises that are effective and don’t require any equipment at all.<br> To make these exercises even more fun, you can blast music while you’re doing them. Some you can even do while watching TV.<br> Now you have no more excuses!  Here are 10 great exercises that you can do at home, without the need for any equipment:<br>Walking – If the weather is nice, it’s wonderful to get outside and enjoy the scenery around you while you exercise.  However, if the weather has other ideas, you can just as easily get an effective walking workout at home.  If you have a flight of stairs, go up and down them a few times.  (You could even grab a load of laundry as you’re going that way anyway!)  This will help to tone up your legs, while getting some low impact aerobic exercise as well.  If you don’t have any stairs available, just walk around the house a few times – it may not be very exciting, but it will do the job!<br>Jumping Jacks – These are always fun, as they bring back memories of being a kid!  Who hasn’t done jumping jacks for fun as a child?  Well, surprise – they are also great cardio exercises, and good for warming up, too.<br>Pushups – These are probably not the most favorite exercise of many people, but while they can be hard to do, you can find easier ways to do them.  You don’t need to pretend you’re “Rocky”, and do them with one hand; just do what works for you.  Do them on your knees, instead of keeping your legs straight.  Or, do them standing up against a wall.  You will be building up arm strength and working out muscles in your chest area.<br>Leg Lifts – These are great for building up strength and muscles in your legs.  If you find it hard to do the exercises with your legs straight, try bending them slightly.<br>Crunches – The best exercise for building up and strengthening abdominal muscles.  When you’re just getting started, don’t worry about getting your head all the way up.  So long as you’re going up until you feel the stretching of the muscles, you will see some benefit.<br>Jogging In Place – Jogging is a great exercise for your heart.  You can jog in place at home while watching TV or listening to music.  The only equipment you will require is a good pair of shoes, to eliminate any stress to your legs.<br>Squats – These are wonderful exercises for your legs and buttocks.  You can even just try these by sitting and standing up again from a regular chair, if you’re finding them to be too difficult.  As long as you’re able to do a few repetitions, you will be providing some benefit to your body.<br>Light Weight Lifting – No, you don’t need to go out and buy expensive weights for this!  Just use whatever you can find in your house.  Start out with something lighter, such as a can of peas, and work yourself up to heavier items.  You can use milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles or even water jugs.<br>Dancing – Dancing is a wonderful exercise, which is great for your heart.  Not only that, but it can lift your spirits as well, and give your overall feeling a boost.<br>Step Exercises – Using the steps in your home, you can do repetitions which will tone your leg muscles.  (Just remember to be careful!)<br>Getting some exercise is important, but you don’t need to go out and join a gym, paying a large amount in membership fees each month.  You don’t even need the expensive equipment in order to give your body an effective workout.  Use what you have in your house, and work out in the comfort of your home.  You will be more likely to keep up with the exercises when you’re comfortable, so just get up and start exercising!"], ["title", "10 Ways You CAN Exercise At Home without Any Equipment"], ["img_url", "https://www.fitwatch.com/files/large/runningshoes.jpg"], ["like_count", 10], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 12:52:42.111720"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 12:52:42.111720"]]

Later in 2020, we'll also see new movies like Black Widow added to the canon, along with MCU TV shows like August's The Falcon and Winter Soldier and December's WandaVision, assuming production resumes on the Disney Plus series soon. A Marvel movie marathon is the perfect way to pass the time until they get here, then. <br>Watching the Marvel movies in order should be pretty simple, but there are a few things worth noting first. Watching the Marvel movies in chronological starts in WW2 with Captain America: The First Avengers, with Cap facing off against Red Skull. If you start the Marvel movies in release order, though, you'll want to begin with 2008's Iron Man, the debut of Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man and the MCU itself.<br>Watching the MCU films in order will give you vital context for Marvel Phase 4. Shows like Loki or new films like The Eternals will build on past Marvel movies in important ways. On this page, you'll find lists of the chronological and release orders of the Marvel movies, as well as a ranked list of the best Marvel movies. If you just want to watch the Avengers movies in order, for example, you can skip the duds (sorry, The Incredible Hulk!). In this feature, too, we'll explain which Marvel movies are on Disney Plus in 2020. <br>Ready? Let's begin your Marvel movie marathon...<br>How to watch the Marvel movies in order: chronological order<br>A Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline is probably why you're here. This lists all the Marvel films chronologically from The First Avenger to Avengers: Endgame. The main reason to watch the Marvel movies like this is you'll see important events as they unfolded in the MCU. You'll follow the Tesseract from the '40s to the present, see how Carol Danvers met Nick Fury in the mid-'90s, and follow Thanos' long, brutal journey to acquiring the Infinity Stones.  <br>Here, then, is the chronological viewing order of the Marvel movies:<ul><li>Captain America: The First Avenger (takes place during WWII)</li><li>Captain Marvel (takes place in 1995)</li><li>Iron Man (takes place in 2010)</li><li>Iron Man 2 (takes place after Iron Man)</li><li>The Incredible Hulk (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>Thor (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>The Avengers (takes place in 2012)</li><li>Iron Man 3 (takes place six months after The Avengers)</li><li>Thor: Dark World (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Captain America: Winter Soldier (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy (sometime in 2014)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (after Guardians)</li><li>Avengers: Age of Ultron (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Ant-Man (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Spider-Man: Homecoming (post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Doctor Strange (takes place in 2016)</li><li>Black Panther (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Thor: Ragnarok (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Ant-Man and The Wasp (ambiguous, but fits nicely between IW and Endgame)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (starts in 2017, finishes in 2022)</li><li>Spider-Man: Far From Home (post-Endgame)</li></ul><br>As 2020 Marvel movies like Black Widow and The Eternals are released, along with canonical Disney Plus shows like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (August) and WandaVision (December), we'll add them to this MCU timeline. Black Widow, for example, is definitely set after Captain America: Civil War, but with its release date currently up in the air, we've left it off for now.

One major negative effect of the pandemic is that small businesses are suffering. As more people are staying in, these establishments are losing customers and money, which is a big deal for small stores. Another (admittedly less pressing) issue that has arisen as a result of COVID-19 is that many of us suddenly have a lot more free time on our hands, and we dont know what to do with it. It turns out, there are several ways to tackle both these problems at once.<br>If social distancing has you stuck inside going stir crazy, there are several activities you can do to pass the time and keep yourself grounded, and many of those activities can be done with the help of local businesses. Ahead, youll find our suggestions for how to stay busy during the coronavirus outbreak while also supporting small businesses in your area.<br>Take a virtual class<br>While gathering in a classroom might not be advisable right now, thanks to the power of the internet, classes of all kinds are still available. Learning something new and thinking critically are great ways to stave off cabin fever. Since many small language schools in the U.S. and abroad have been forced to shut down in-person sessions, look into how you can support them by signing up for virtual language classes.<br>If its your body that needs exercising right now and not just your mind, check to see if local fitness studios are streaming sessions with instructors. Its tempting to sit in one spot all day when you have nowhere to be, but exercise is known to help with anxiety, and right now, many of us could use all the help we can get in that department.<br>Start a craft project<br>In the past, have youve bristled at the what are your hobbies question simply because you dont have time to do anything just for its own sake? Well, now you might actually have the bandwidth to pick up a hobby, and why not look to the arts and crafts arena? Find a small arts and crafts supply store in your area and purchase everything you'll need to create a masterpiece: think yarn and needles for knitting, needlepoint kits, or paints and canvases. If youre nervous about starting a new creative project, use the store as a resource — one of the best things about small businesses is that those who work at them are almost always extremely passionate about their area of expertise. Theyll likely have advice on where you should start.<br>Do puzzles & play games<br>Another great way to put your brain to work is by doing a puzzle. Whether its a traditional jigsaw or a book of Sudoku, puzzles are extremely stimulating, and they can be purchased at local game shops.<br>If youre looking to compete against someone other than yourself, get some board or card games from that small business.

If so, order ingredients to cook something thats outside of your regular quick-dinner rotation.<br>Small specialty food stores might also carry baking kits that can help you whip up a treat youd usually only ever buy at a fancy bakery. Instead of binging Great British Bake Off for the umpteenth time, get off the couch and make something spectacular yourself.<br>Read some books<br>All those books youve been meaning to read can finally get the attention they deserve. Reach out to your local book store to see how theyre handling the coronavirus outbreak. If the show is delivering or open to quick pop-ins from a limited number of customers at a time, stock up on a pile of books and get to reading.<br>Start an indoor garden<br>It might seem surprising but one of the most effective ways to practice self-care is to take care of something other than yourself. With that in mind, this might be the perfect opportunity to start an indoor garden.

Well, as nice as it sounds, it just isn’t an option for most people.  And since exercise is so important, you need to find exercises that are effective and don’t require any equipment at all.<br> To make these exercises even more fun, you can blast music while you’re doing them. Some you can even do while watching TV.<br> Now you have no more excuses!  Here are 10 great exercises that you can do at home, without the need for any equipment:<br>Walking – If the weather is nice, it’s wonderful to get outside and enjoy the scenery around you while you exercise.  However, if the weather has other ideas, you can just as easily get an effective walking workout at home.  If you have a flight of stairs, go up and down them a few times.  (You could even grab a load of laundry as you’re going that way anyway!)  This will help to tone up your legs, while getting some low impact aerobic exercise as well.  If you don’t have any stairs available, just walk around the house a few times – it may not be very exciting, but it will do the job!<br>Jumping Jacks – These are always fun, as they bring back memories of being a kid!  Who hasn’t done jumping jacks for fun as a child?  Well, surprise – they are also great cardio exercises, and good for warming up, too.<br>Pushups – These are probably not the most favorite exercise of many people, but while they can be hard to do, you can find easier ways to do them.  You don’t need to pretend you’re “Rocky”, and do them with one hand; just do what works for you.  Do them on your knees, instead of keeping your legs straight.  Or, do them standing up against a wall.  You will be building up arm strength and working out muscles in your chest area.<br>Leg Lifts – These are great for building up strength and muscles in your legs.  If you find it hard to do the exercises with your legs straight, try bending them slightly.<br>Crunches – The best exercise for building up and strengthening abdominal muscles.  When you’re just getting started, don’t worry about getting your head all the way up.  So long as you’re going up until you feel the stretching of the muscles, you will see some benefit.<br>Jogging In Place – Jogging is a great exercise for your heart.  You can jog in place at home while watching TV or listening to music.  The only equipment you will require is a good pair of shoes, to eliminate any stress to your legs.<br>Squats – These are wonderful exercises for your legs and buttocks.  You can even just try these by sitting and standing up again from a regular chair, if you’re finding them to be too difficult.  As long as you’re able to do a few repetitions, you will be providing some benefit to your body.<br>Light Weight Lifting – No, you don’t need to go out and buy expensive weights for this!  Just use whatever you can find in your house.  Start out with something lighter, such as a can of peas, and work yourself up to heavier items.  You can use milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles or even water jugs.<br>Dancing – Dancing is a wonderful exercise, which is great for your heart.  Not only that, but it can lift your spirits as well, and give your overall feeling a boost.<br>Step Exercises – Using the steps in your home, you can do repetitions which will tone your leg muscles.  (Just remember to be careful!)<br>Getting some exercise is important, but you don’t need to go out and join a gym, paying a large amount in membership fees each month.  You don’t even need the expensive equipment in order to give your body an effective workout.  Use what you have in your house, and work out in the comfort of your home.  You will be more likely to keep up with the exercises when you’re comfortable, so just get up and start exercising!"], ["title", "10 Ways You CAN Exercise At Home without Any Equipment"], ["img_url", "https://www.fitwatch.com/files/large/runningshoes.jpg"], ["like_count", 10], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 12:57:15.139483"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 12:57:15.139483"]]

Later in 2020, we'll also see new movies like Black Widow added to the canon, along with MCU TV shows like August's The Falcon and Winter Soldier and December's WandaVision, assuming production resumes on the Disney Plus series soon. A Marvel movie marathon is the perfect way to pass the time until they get here, then. <br>Watching the Marvel movies in order should be pretty simple, but there are a few things worth noting first. Watching the Marvel movies in chronological starts in WW2 with Captain America: The First Avengers, with Cap facing off against Red Skull. If you start the Marvel movies in release order, though, you'll want to begin with 2008's Iron Man, the debut of Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man and the MCU itself.<br>Watching the MCU films in order will give you vital context for Marvel Phase 4. Shows like Loki or new films like The Eternals will build on past Marvel movies in important ways. On this page, you'll find lists of the chronological and release orders of the Marvel movies, as well as a ranked list of the best Marvel movies. If you just want to watch the Avengers movies in order, for example, you can skip the duds (sorry, The Incredible Hulk!). In this feature, too, we'll explain which Marvel movies are on Disney Plus in 2020. <br>Ready? Let's begin your Marvel movie marathon...<br>How to watch the Marvel movies in order: chronological order<br>A Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline is probably why you're here. This lists all the Marvel films chronologically from The First Avenger to Avengers: Endgame. The main reason to watch the Marvel movies like this is you'll see important events as they unfolded in the MCU. You'll follow the Tesseract from the '40s to the present, see how Carol Danvers met Nick Fury in the mid-'90s, and follow Thanos' long, brutal journey to acquiring the Infinity Stones.  <br>Here, then, is the chronological viewing order of the Marvel movies:<ul><li>Captain America: The First Avenger (takes place during WWII)</li><li>Captain Marvel (takes place in 1995)</li><li>Iron Man (takes place in 2010)</li><li>Iron Man 2 (takes place after Iron Man)</li><li>The Incredible Hulk (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>Thor (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>The Avengers (takes place in 2012)</li><li>Iron Man 3 (takes place six months after The Avengers)</li><li>Thor: Dark World (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Captain America: Winter Soldier (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy (sometime in 2014)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (after Guardians)</li><li>Avengers: Age of Ultron (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Ant-Man (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Spider-Man: Homecoming (post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Doctor Strange (takes place in 2016)</li><li>Black Panther (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Thor: Ragnarok (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Ant-Man and The Wasp (ambiguous, but fits nicely between IW and Endgame)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (starts in 2017, finishes in 2022)</li><li>Spider-Man: Far From Home (post-Endgame)</li></ul><br>As 2020 Marvel movies like Black Widow and The Eternals are released, along with canonical Disney Plus shows like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (August) and WandaVision (December), we'll add them to this MCU timeline. Black Widow, for example, is definitely set after Captain America: Civil War, but with its release date currently up in the air, we've left it off for now.

One major negative effect of the pandemic is that small businesses are suffering. As more people are staying in, these establishments are losing customers and money, which is a big deal for small stores. Another (admittedly less pressing) issue that has arisen as a result of COVID-19 is that many of us suddenly have a lot more free time on our hands, and we dont know what to do with it. It turns out, there are several ways to tackle both these problems at once.<br>If social distancing has you stuck inside going stir crazy, there are several activities you can do to pass the time and keep yourself grounded, and many of those activities can be done with the help of local businesses. Ahead, youll find our suggestions for how to stay busy during the coronavirus outbreak while also supporting small businesses in your area.<br>Take a virtual class<br>While gathering in a classroom might not be advisable right now, thanks to the power of the internet, classes of all kinds are still available. Learning something new and thinking critically are great ways to stave off cabin fever. Since many small language schools in the U.S. and abroad have been forced to shut down in-person sessions, look into how you can support them by signing up for virtual language classes.<br>If its your body that needs exercising right now and not just your mind, check to see if local fitness studios are streaming sessions with instructors. Its tempting to sit in one spot all day when you have nowhere to be, but exercise is known to help with anxiety, and right now, many of us could use all the help we can get in that department.<br>Start a craft project<br>In the past, have youve bristled at the what are your hobbies question simply because you dont have time to do anything just for its own sake? Well, now you might actually have the bandwidth to pick up a hobby, and why not look to the arts and crafts arena? Find a small arts and crafts supply store in your area and purchase everything you'll need to create a masterpiece: think yarn and needles for knitting, needlepoint kits, or paints and canvases. If youre nervous about starting a new creative project, use the store as a resource — one of the best things about small businesses is that those who work at them are almost always extremely passionate about their area of expertise. Theyll likely have advice on where you should start.<br>Do puzzles & play games<br>Another great way to put your brain to work is by doing a puzzle. Whether its a traditional jigsaw or a book of Sudoku, puzzles are extremely stimulating, and they can be purchased at local game shops.<br>If youre looking to compete against someone other than yourself, get some board or card games from that small business. Ask the shopkeepers for their suggestions for the most invigorating and entertaining games that can include all your roommates.<br>Bake or cook something special<br>Instead of going straight to AmazonFresh for grocery deliveries, take the extra time — we know you have it or else you wouldnt be reading this article — to see if independent grocers or farmers markets in your area are offering delivery. If so, order ingredients to cook something thats outside of your regular quick-dinner rotation.<br>Small specialty food stores might also carry baking kits that can help you whip up a treat youd usually only ever buy at a fancy bakery. Instead of binging Great British Bake Off for the umpteenth time, get off the couch and make something spectacular yourself.<br>Read some books<br>All those books youve been meaning to read can finally get the attention they deserve. Reach out to your local book store to see how theyre handling the coronavirus outbreak. If the show is delivering or open to quick pop-ins from a limited number of customers at a time, stock up on a pile of books and get to reading.<br>Start an indoor garden<br>It might seem surprising but one of the most effective ways to practice self-care is to take care of something other than yourself. With that in mind, this might be the perfect opportunity to start an indoor garden.

Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

Well, as nice as it sounds, it just isn’t an option for most people.  And since exercise is so important, you need to find exercises that are effective and don’t require any equipment at all.<br> To make these exercises even more fun, you can blast music while you’re doing them. Some you can even do while watching TV.<br> Now you have no more excuses!  Here are 10 great exercises that you can do at home, without the need for any equipment:<br>Walking – If the weather is nice, it’s wonderful to get outside and enjoy the scenery around you while you exercise.  However, if the weather has other ideas, you can just as easily get an effective walking workout at home.  If you have a flight of stairs, go up and down them a few times.  (You could even grab a load of laundry as you’re going that way anyway!)  This will help to tone up your legs, while getting some low impact aerobic exercise as well.  If you don’t have any stairs available, just walk around the house a few times – it may not be very exciting, but it will do the job!<br>Jumping Jacks – These are always fun, as they bring back memories of being a kid!  Who hasn’t done jumping jacks for fun as a child?  Well, surprise – they are also great cardio exercises, and good for warming up, too.<br>Pushups – These are probably not the most favorite exercise of many people, but while they can be hard to do, you can find easier ways to do them.  You don’t need to pretend you’re “Rocky”, and do them with one hand; just do what works for you.  Do them on your knees, instead of keeping your legs straight.  Or, do them standing up against a wall.  You will be building up arm strength and working out muscles in your chest area.<br>Leg Lifts – These are great for building up strength and muscles in your legs.  If you find it hard to do the exercises with your legs straight, try bending them slightly.<br>Crunches – The best exercise for building up and strengthening abdominal muscles.  When you’re just getting started, don’t worry about getting your head all the way up.  So long as you’re going up until you feel the stretching of the muscles, you will see some benefit.<br>Jogging In Place – Jogging is a great exercise for your heart.  You can jog in place at home while watching TV or listening to music.  The only equipment you will require is a good pair of shoes, to eliminate any stress to your legs.<br>Squats – These are wonderful exercises for your legs and buttocks.  You can even just try these by sitting and standing up again from a regular chair, if you’re finding them to be too difficult.  As long as you’re able to do a few repetitions, you will be providing some benefit to your body.<br>Light Weight Lifting – No, you don’t need to go out and buy expensive weights for this!  Just use whatever you can find in your house.  Start out with something lighter, such as a can of peas, and work yourself up to heavier items.  You can use milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles or even water jugs.<br>Dancing – Dancing is a wonderful exercise, which is great for your heart.  Not only that, but it can lift your spirits as well, and give your overall feeling a boost.<br>Step Exercises – Using the steps in your home, you can do repetitions which will tone your leg muscles.  (Just remember to be careful!)<br>Getting some exercise is important, but you don’t need to go out and join a gym, paying a large amount in membership fees each month.  You don’t even need the expensive equipment in order to give your body an effective workout.  Use what you have in your house, and work out in the comfort of your home.  You will be more likely to keep up with the exercises when you’re comfortable, so just get up and start exercising!"], ["title", "10 Ways You CAN Exercise At Home without Any Equipment"], ["img_url", "https://www.fitwatch.com/files/large/runningshoes.jpg"], ["like_count", 10], ["created_at", "2020-03-27 13:00:39.212929"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-27 13:00:39.212929"]]

Later in 2020, we'll also see new movies like Black Widow added to the canon, along with MCU TV shows like August's The Falcon and Winter Soldier and December's WandaVision, assuming production resumes on the Disney Plus series soon. A Marvel movie marathon is the perfect way to pass the time until they get here, then. <br>Watching the Marvel movies in order should be pretty simple, but there are a few things worth noting first. Watching the Marvel movies in chronological starts in WW2 with Captain America: The First Avengers, with Cap facing off against Red Skull.

This lists all the Marvel films chronologically from The First Avenger to Avengers: Endgame. The main reason to watch the Marvel movies like this is you'll see important events as they unfolded in the MCU. You'll follow the Tesseract from the '40s to the present, see how Carol Danvers met Nick Fury in the mid-'90s, and follow Thanos' long, brutal journey to acquiring the Infinity Stones.  <br>Here, then, is the chronological viewing order of the Marvel movies:<ul><li>Captain America: The First Avenger (takes place during WWII)</li><li>Captain Marvel (takes place in 1995)</li><li>Iron Man (takes place in 2010)</li><li>Iron Man 2 (takes place after Iron Man)</li><li>The Incredible Hulk (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>Thor (time unspecified, pre-Avengers)</li><li>The Avengers (takes place in 2012)</li><li>Iron Man 3 (takes place six months after The Avengers)</li><li>Thor: Dark World (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Captain America: Winter Soldier (post-Avengers, pre-Ultron)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy (sometime in 2014)</li><li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (after Guardians)</li><li>Avengers: Age of Ultron (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Ant-Man (takes place in 2015)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Spider-Man: Homecoming (post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Doctor Strange (takes place in 2016)</li><li>Black Panther (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Thor: Ragnarok (post-Ultron, pre-Infinity War)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (takes place in 2017)</li><li>Ant-Man and The Wasp (ambiguous, but fits nicely between IW and Endgame)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (starts in 2017, finishes in 2022)</li><li>Spider-Man: Far From Home (post-Endgame)</li></ul><br>As 2020 Marvel movies like Black Widow and The Eternals are released, along with canonical Disney Plus shows like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (August) and WandaVision (December), we'll add them to this MCU timeline.

As we are staying at home, there has been a lot of pool time, reading lots of books, doing arts and crafts, and when the kids go to sleep my husband and I play cards or do a puzzle,” says Malin. The photographer has a new children’s book, A World of Opposites, coming out and is offering free shipping and framing on all prints — along with a complimentary beach puzzle with purchase — this month: Its now more important than ever to support small business.<br>Order a Bunch of Puzzles or Do Some Crosswords<br>Looking for a solitary activity?

One major negative effect of the pandemic is that small businesses are suffering. As more people are staying in, these establishments are losing customers and money, which is a big deal for small stores. Another (admittedly less pressing) issue that has arisen as a result of COVID-19 is that many of us suddenly have a lot more free time on our hands, and we dont know what to do with it. It turns out, there are several ways to tackle both these problems at once.<br>If social distancing has you stuck inside going stir crazy, there are several activities you can do to pass the time and keep yourself grounded, and many of those activities can be done with the help of local businesses. Ahead, youll find our suggestions for how to stay busy during the coronavirus outbreak while also supporting small businesses in your area.<br>Take a virtual class<br>While gathering in a classroom might not be advisable right now, thanks to the power of the internet, classes of all kinds are still available. Learning something new and thinking critically are great ways to stave off cabin fever. Since many small language schools in the U.S. and abroad have been forced to shut down in-person sessions, look into how you can support them by signing up for virtual language classes.<br>If its your body that needs exercising right now and not just your mind, check to see if local fitness studios are streaming sessions with instructors. Its tempting to sit in one spot all day when you have nowhere to be, but exercise is known to help with anxiety, and right now, many of us could use all the help we can get in that department.<br>Start a craft project<br>In the past, have youve bristled at the what are your hobbies question simply because you dont have time to do anything just for its own sake? Well, now you might actually have the bandwidth to pick up a hobby, and why not look to the arts and crafts arena? Find a small arts and crafts supply store in your area and purchase everything you'll need to create a masterpiece: think yarn and needles for knitting, needlepoint kits, or paints and canvases. If youre nervous about starting a new creative project, use the store as a resource — one of the best things about small businesses is that those who work at them are almost always extremely passionate about their area of expertise. Theyll likely have advice on where you should start.<br>Do puzzles & play games<br>Another great way to put your brain to work is by doing a puzzle. Whether its a traditional jigsaw or a book of Sudoku, puzzles are extremely stimulating, and they can be purchased at local game shops.<br>If youre looking to compete against someone other than yourself, get some board or card games from that small business. Ask the shopkeepers for their suggestions for the most invigorating and entertaining games that can include all your roommates.<br>Bake or cook something special<br>Instead of going straight to AmazonFresh for grocery deliveries, take the extra time — we know you have it or else you wouldnt be reading this article — to see if independent grocers or farmers markets in your area are offering delivery. If so, order ingredients to cook something thats outside of your regular quick-dinner rotation.<br>Small specialty food stores might also carry baking kits that can help you whip up a treat youd usually only ever buy at a fancy bakery. Instead of binging Great British Bake Off for the umpteenth time, get off the couch and make something spectacular yourself.<br>Read some books<br>All those books youve been meaning to read can finally get the attention they deserve. Reach out to your local book store to see how theyre handling the coronavirus outbreak. If the show is delivering or open to quick pop-ins from a limited number of customers at a time, stock up on a pile of books and get to reading.<br>Start an indoor garden<br>It might seem surprising but one of the most effective ways to practice self-care is to take care of something other than yourself. With that in mind, this might be the perfect opportunity to start an indoor garden. Start your plant lady journey by reaching out to your local plant store to find out which type of greenery will do best in your home and if the store is offering delivery during this time. For those of us who dont have yards to escape into while still social distancing, becoming a plant mom will be especially rewarding.<br>COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic.
